# Running solutions with Rust:

Run solutions with `cargo run {day} {part} {input file name}`

For example, to run Day 1 Part 1 with the puzzle input, from the `src` directory, you would run 

`cargo run 1 1 day01/input.txt`

To run Day 1 Part 1 from the `day01` directory, just run

`cargo run 1 1 input.txt`
